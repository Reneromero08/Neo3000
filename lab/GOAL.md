# Active Goal

## Checkpoint 1: Compute map

Checkpoint 0 is closed. Neo3000 is baseline-operational. The runtime serves Agents-A1 to Pi correctly, context scales through 60K occupied tokens with a 0.94 degradation ratio, rolling minimum decode is smooth, tools and cancellation are verified, and LM Studio is no longer an unlock dependency.

RSI-0 is closed with the supervised substrate proven:

```text
RSI-0A source custody: done
RSI-0B stable/candidate worktrees: live isolation proven
RSI-0C evaluator lockfile and protected mutation preflight: proven
RSI-0D neo-loop machinery and enforcement gates: proven
RSI-0F live rejection cycle: passed
RSI-0G live reviewable acceptance cycle: passed
```

## Required result

```text
Stable worktree running Neo3000
+ isolated candidate worktree
+ immutable evaluator with lockfile-protected hashes
+ deterministic neo-loop machinery
+ enforced candidate edit allowlist
+ enforced stop, timeout, memory, port, and cleanup gates
+ supervised rejection cycle demonstrated
+ supervised acceptance cycle demonstrated
+ stable survives all candidate activity
```

## Current boundary

The authorized RSI-0G cycle returned `reviewable-accept`: the inert candidate fixture passed transport, reasoning, tool, cancellation, repeat, warm-performance, WDDM, cleanup, and stable-integrity gates. Stable PID `31188` was unchanged; candidate PID/listener `38952` tore down and its WDDM instances retired. **RSI-0 is closed; `SUPERVISED_BOUNDED_RSI_AVAILABLE` is unlocked for Level 1 supervised work.**

Do not begin autonomous RSI. Do not modify stable inference logic. Do not promote candidates automatically.

## Next exact action

The next objective is one supervised instrumentation candidate that maps actual CUDA/CPU backend placement, silent CPU fallback, CUDA graph capture/replay, synchronization, MoE expert bucket geometry, and Gated Delta Net recurrent-state cost while stable remains untouched. This is not authorization for autonomous RSI or automatic promotion.

Minimum required work:

```text
1. Keep the stable server and stable worktree unchanged.
2. Define one fixed trace schema and a trace-disabled versus trace-enabled candidate comparison.
3. Keep tracing optional and compiled out in normal builds.
4. Measure first-request and per-token placement/synchronization costs without modifying stable inference.
```

## Unlock target

```text
SUPERVISED_BOUNDED_RSI_AVAILABLE
```

Unlocked: RSI-0E, RSI-0F, and RSI-0G are all supported by executed evidence. Automatic promotion remains disabled.
